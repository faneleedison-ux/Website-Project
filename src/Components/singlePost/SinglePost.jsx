        What Is A Website?
        <br/><br/>

The World Wide Web (WWW), also known as the Web, is the world's leading software platform. It is an online data environment where documents and other web resources can be viewed using a web browser through the Internet. The Web has had a huge impact on people's lives, and it is the major tool that billions of people use to interact on the internet.(Bleigh, 2014).

<br/><br/>

What Is Webart?
<br/><br/>
Webart are works of interactive art on the internet and can be characterised as an area of interactive expression in which limits and possibilities are tried out and explored through works of art. A work of WebArt can be seen as needing an act of interactivity from the user in order to be changed and brought into existence at a different level. This is brought about through a bodily action: the mouse is moved around or clicked in order to explore and bring about changes in the work of WebArt (Gjedde and Ingemann, 2002) . the works of Webart as defined by Gjedde and Ingemann as:

“encompassing two areas: One is the frame of possibilities of the work of WebArt: this includes all the elements present in the interface and the interactive choices the users make. The other is the frame of possibilities of the user: the personal relevance, the experience and the values which the user brings to the encounter with the work of WebArt. It also includes their willingness to get involved with the work of WebArt and enter into a dialogue with it.” (Gjedde and Ingemann, 2002) 

<br/><br/>

What Is Good Design For WebArt?
<br/><br/>
Ji Yong Park’s, from Central Queensland University in Australia, study for essential components of the user experience via net art for interactive user experience design and states that “Net art enables the designers to bridge the gap between traditional graphic design and interactive user experience in that it has empowered the users to be an interactive artist” (Park, 2007, pg 2).  As a result, Webart questions accepted beliefs about what the web is, how it operates, and how users interact with and experience life on the internet  (Park, 2007, pg 4).

Invisible design elements, collaborative participation, anarchic structure, and non-linear communication are four crucial aspects Park mentions in his research paper that designers must consider while creating for the virtual environment (Park, 2007, pg 4).

Aesthetics vs. Functionality
<br/><br/>
Aesthetics
<br/><br/>
The term aesthetics in the context of this article covers visual, sound and interactive means of effect. However, the article focuses primarily on the visual means of effect in terms of colours, typography, design, pictures, video clips, flash animations, etc. Visual communication is a reality as soon as a word is typed, a colour chosen, or a text displayed on the screen, and any visual expression, whether it is intentional or not, communicates something to the visitor of the site  (Thorlacius, 2007, pg 62).

According to Thorlacius, there are 4 main areas of aesthetics in design (Thorlacius, 2007, pg 67) :
 
Support the Content and Functionality
Appeal to the Audience
Sender Image
Supporting Genre
Thorlacius states that we have replaced language with symbols to navigate the web. We have evolved to react to visuals in efficient and effective ways. (Thorlacius, 2007, pg 62).

<br/><br/>
Functionality
<br/><br/>
The term functionality refers to the user-friendly aspects of interfaces and Human Computer Interaction (HCI), with the main goal of creating effective websites where the user can obtain the desired information quickly and efficiently without being delayed by long download times or blind alleys while navigating the site (Thorlacius, 2007, pg 63).


The functionality allows the user to browse the site effectively and efficiently, as well as execute tasks like searching for information, entering and sending information, and using any of the site's features. This brings us to the topic of usability. Usability can be defined as how simple it is to use the site's functionality's features. When it comes to functioning, the usability factor determines if something is good or bad (Thorlacius, 2007, pg 63).



Other Things That I Researched
<br/><br/>

The importance of aesthetics and usability in web design:
<br/><br/>
The focus of website design usability is on a website's ease of use. This can involve presenting concise and useful information about the website's topic. The strategic positioning of content inside the website in relevant regions is also taken into account. Website usability is critical when it comes to implementing a website into an art business strategy. The usability of a website makes a positive impression on visitors who may become potential clients. Making the website simple to navigate is a crucial approach for allowing users to quickly locate what they're looking for. Visitors will just move on to another relevant website that offers what they seek if this functionality is not available. As a result, a potential customer is lost (GJEDDE and INGEMANN, 2002).

Examples of WebART
<br/><br/>
The internet is filled with thousands of webart but here are a few examples of interesting old webart that you can check that will inspire you or make you thinking more deeply about ways we can merge tech developments and art: 

<br/><br/>

My Boyfriend Came Home From The War
<br/><br/>

Interactive hypertext storytelling is seen in My Boyfriend Came Back From the War. The work is made up of stacked frames with black and white web pages and grainy GIF graphics (sometimes animated). The frame divides into tiny frames when the user clicks hyperlinks in the work, revealing a nonlinear story about a couple who is reunited after a nameless military fight. The lovers are having trouble reuniting; the woman admits to having an affair with a neighbour, while the returned soldier proposes marriage. The plot progresses to the point where the screen has become a mosaic of black frames with no content.
Because of the work's resemblance to a movie plot, Olia Lialina refers to it as a netfilm.
“The grainy black-and-white images and intertitles refer to early silent movies” (Connor, 2016).

Mochette - “On The Internet No-One Knows You Are A Dog”
<br/><br/>
The website that toys with and explores the issues of identity online. Mouchette persona is loosely based on Robert Bresson’s 1967 film ‘Moucgette’.

Jodi
<br/><br/>
Jodi, is a collective of two internet artists, Joan Heemskerk and Dirk Paesmans created in 1994. They were some of the first artists to create Web art and later started to create software art and artistic computer game modification. This is their most well-known art piece that is a webart, which is a landscape of intricate designs made in basic HTML

Conclusion
<br/><br/>
Finally, both Thorlacius and Park make compelling arguments about the importance of aesthetics vs functionality. Both factors are essential to me, although I believe functionality is significantly more vital than aesthetics. A website can appear nice on the front-end, but if it doesn't work properly, the user experience becomes unpleasant and declines. The complete end product of websites is influenced by factors such as navigation, page routing, searching for specific items, and page loading speeds. Despite the fact that these are the foundations of functioning, if these components are not well-developed, the website will not be usable by users.
However, if a website does not look appealing aesthetically, users will lose interest in the important information that is being presented because it is unpleasant to look at. Thorlacius claims that the 1990s and subsequently the twenty-first century were times when one element was sacrificed and the other was favoured. (Thorlacius, 2007, pg 65). This should not be the case, in my opinion, because these aspects can and should coexist. It's all about striking the right balance between the two to create the right website.
